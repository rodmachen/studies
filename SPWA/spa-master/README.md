# Purpose

These are the resources discussed in the book 
**Single Page Web Applications - JavaScript end-to-end**.

- **Source Code** : The `/listings` directory contains all the source code
from the book, along with a few extras.

- **Quick Reference** : The quick-reference cheat-sheet is a condensation of 
**Appendix A - Code standards**.

- **jQuery Plugins** : If you are looking jQuery plugins, a quick list can be found
[on the plugin site](http://plugins.jquery.com/?s=mikowskihttp://plugins.jquery.com/?s=mikowski).

# Collaborate

The listings are provided for reference and collaboration.

the same work in a public project, we would very much appreciate

### Standards

I hope to post the full standards here in the near future so that
they may be continually updated by the community.

### Slides

The slides directory holds slides for some of my public presentations.  All of these
have been presented at [HTML5DevConf](http://html5devconf.com/) and various
other locations such as [USF](http://www.usfca.edu/),
